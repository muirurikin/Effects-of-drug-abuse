<h1>Psychological Drug Abuse Effects</h1>
<p>One of the primary effects of drug abuse can be found within the <a href="http://www.healthyplace.com/addictions/drug-addiction/drug-abuse-and-addiction-whats-the-difference/" target="_blank" title="Drug Abuse Definition">definition of drug abuse</a> itself: an increasing, intense desire to use the drug above all else. Drug craving can shift a person's entire mental focus to obtaining the drug. Side effects of drug abuse then include preoccupation with where to get the drug, how to get money for the drug, and where and when the drug can be used.</p>
<p>Psychological drug abuse effects commonly include changes in mood. A person may be anxious, thinking about when they can next use the drug, or depressed due to drug side effects.</p>

<p>Other psychological drug abuse side effects include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aggressiveness or irritability</li>
<li>Selfishness</li>
<li>Hopelessness</li>
<li>Lack of pleasure from previously enjoyed activities</li>
<li>Pressuring others into doing drugs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Effects On The Brain</h2>

<p>Although initial drug use may be voluntary, drugs have been shown to alter brain chemistry, which interferes with an individual's ability to make decisions and can lead to compulsive craving, seeking and use. This then becomes a substance dependency.</p>

<ul>
<li>All drugs of abuse - nicotine, cocaine, marijuana, and others - effect the brain's "reward" circuit, which is part of the limbic system.</li>
<li>Drugs hijack this "reward" system, causing unusually large amounts of dopamine to flood the system.</li>
<li>This flood of dopamine is what causes the "high" or euphoria associated with drug abuse. </li>
</ul>
